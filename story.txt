When I was a boy, I knew I was different. The other kids would be out at recess playing tag or football, and I would sit on the concrete, daydreaming about one thing and one thing only. Choo-choo trains. They were my life. Even before seeing them in person, I obsessed about them for every moment of every waking hour, and then vast train fantasies captured me as I slept. My peers would talk to girls and form relationships, but I didn't care about relationships. I focused only on the choo-choo trains. My whole life revolved around them, but only one moment sticks out to me as I lay on my deathbed.

I am taken back to when I was in my 50s. I always took the train to work. My wife insisted that we buy a car, and that I would save hours on the commute each week, but I did
not listen. Nothing could keep me from the trains, until one day I saw it, the most beautiful piece of machinery and innovation I had ever laid my eyes on. My job required that I travel across the country for business, I had pleaded, "please, please let me take the train!", but my boss would not have any of it. "You're flying and that's that", he decreed. I begrudingly dragged myself to the airport that fateful morning, anticipating nothing but disdain for these so called "airplanes", but then I heard a sound that could only be described as a wall of thunder, and that's when I saw it.
