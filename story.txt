When I was a boy, I knew I was different. The other kids would be out at recess playing tag or football, and I would sit on the concrete, daydreaming about one thing and one thing only. Choo-choo trains. They were my life. Even before seeing them in person, I obsessed about them for every moment of every waking hour, and then vast train fantasies captured me as I slept. My peers would talk to girls and form relationships, but I didn't care about relationships. I focused only on the choo-choo trains. My whole life revolved around them, but only one moment sticks out to me as I lay on my deathbed.
